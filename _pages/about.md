Jeffrey is an evolutionary biologist turned hacker turned global security researcher. His research was born in the field, tracking and recording Myotis bats to better understand interspecies communication. As he studied evolutionary dynamics in human systems, he decided to leave academia to learn more practical skills. Jeffrey pivoted to information security and started fighting in the Sisyphean struggle, defending tech companies from credit card fraud and cyber espionage. He fought on numerous fronts, from the towering behemoth Concur Technologies to the cryptocurrency wild west at Reserve.

At some point, we all have to ask ourselves what kind of future we are building. Jeffrey's answer came after a deep dive into emerging technologies and military innovation. Since the invention of nuclear weapons, a terrifying game of nuclear deterrence is all that has kept human civilization from collapsing from the impact of thousands of thermonuclear warheads. While we have achieved temporary stability, the march of technological innovation continues on, creating new threats and opportunities for humanity. 

Jeffrey studies the intersection of emerging technologies and global conflict. Currently, only states wield technologies powerful enough to threaten global civilization. While nuclear weapons were a clear first in their destructive power and blinding speed, advances in cyber weapons, synthetic biology, and AI will likely bring about new kinds of global threats. Will advances in machine learning harm second strike capabilities of the US, China, and Russia? Will cheap, inexpensive drone technology enable mass assassinations? How can global powers with a past history of nuclear threats and proxy wars coordinate to prevent catastrophes that would be detrimental to everyone?

If these kinds of questions sound practical to you, not as intellectual exercises but as part of a necessary research agenda, feel free to reach out. I'm always on the lookout for collaborators.
