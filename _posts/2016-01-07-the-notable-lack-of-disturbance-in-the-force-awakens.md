Take a moment to remember the saddest scene in The Force Awakens. Was it Kylo Ren kills Han Solo? When R2D2 wouldn’t wake up, a loyal droid grieving for its missing master? How about the deaths of 35 billion innocent people? When the First Order’s new superweapon, ‘Starkiller’, destroyed five heavily inhabited planets, there was no disturbance in the force, at least none on screen. For a film that heavily followed the plot and motifs of the original Star Wars film, the lack of empathy for the instantaneous slaughter of billions of humans and other intelligent life forms stands out. Remember the destruction of Alderaan, with Leia forced to watch as her home world and all its people were destroyed? Remember Obi Wan’s sudden reaction of dismay?...
